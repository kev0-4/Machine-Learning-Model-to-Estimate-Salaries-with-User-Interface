# Salary Estimation Machine Learning Webapp
Machine Learning Model trained using Lasso with a HTML/CSS UI built on top of it.<br>
This repository contains a machine learning model and a web application for predicting salaries based on various factors such as age, years of experience, gender, education, and position.

## ***Project Overview***
This project was aimed to train a machine learning model for predicting salaries based on various factors: Age, Education Level, Job Title, Gender, Experience.<br>
The model was trained using Lasso algorithm.<br>
A HTML/CSS ui is built to interact with this model. <br>
