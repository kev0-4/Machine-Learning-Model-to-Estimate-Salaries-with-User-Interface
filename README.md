# Salary Estimation Machine Learning Model & Webapp
Machine Learning Model trained using Lasso with a HTML/CSS UI built on top of it.<br>
This repository contains a machine learning model and a web application for predicting salaries based on various factors such as age, years of experience, gender, education, and position.

## ***Project Overview***
The Salary Prediction web application is a machine learning-based tool that predicts the salary of individuals based on various features such as age, gender, education, years of experience, and job position. It utilizes a pre-trained machine learning model to make accurate salary estimates<br>
The project is implemented with a modular and scalable approach, allowing for easy maintenance and future enhancements.<br>
The model was trained using Lasso algorithm.<br>
The web application has a user-friendly interface where users can input their information and receive an estimated salary as the output. The application makes use of JavaScript for client-side functionality<br>
And server side was built using Flask Framework (python)
